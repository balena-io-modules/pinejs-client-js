      hash: 1077e19ef18cc4cede4d6401496a016fef459150
      body: |
        This requires passing the model typings when creating the pinejs-client
        instance and will mean that any usage after that will be type checked
        to limit to resources/properties that exist on the model. This covers
        almost all usage but there are some cases we cannot cover as we would
        need typescript support for partial inference of generics, eg for
        lambdas, or to make major changes to the querying interface.
        This work should also be fully backwards compatible such that if you do
        not provide model typings then all typings should continue to work as
        previously

      hash: 5ad1d4a417e2631d70acf7192b7132366a77be3b
      body: |
        The intention is that these are use as helpers functions to build the
        url from an object and so passing a `url` directly is not really the
        intent and interferes with improving the typings for the intended case.
        It is still possible to pass urls directly to the `request` function if
        it is essential but the true answer is to support building those urls,
        and using `prepare` if it is necessary

        This is because they are not designed to support using a `url` and are
        likely to break in very weird and unexpected ways, and as such removing
        it from the typing should reduce potential for surprising errors

        The subscribe method takes the same parameters as the get method and
        returns an

        event emitter. The emitter will periodically run the request specified
        in the

        parameters and emit the response.

        Connects to #50
